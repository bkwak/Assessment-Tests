Jest Tests for Grad Assessment


Make sure to install jest by running "npm install jest -D" and then copy the test files into the assessment directory that you're grading.


Run the tests with "jest" in the terminal (so easy a fellow could do it). 


You'll still have to look over the resident's solution code, but this helps check for the edge cases and functionality specified in the grading rubric. As always, feel free to PR with more tests or anything else you can think of!
